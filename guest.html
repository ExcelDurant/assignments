                Elon Musk is working to revolutionize transportation both on Earth, through electric car maker Tesla - and in space, via rocket producer SpaceX.
                He owns 21% of Tesla but has pledged more than half his stake as collateral for loans; Forbes has discounted his stake to take the loans into account.
                He settled with the SEC in September 2018 for making alleged "false statements" about a plan to take Tesla private, and had to step down as chairman.
                SpaceX, Musk's rocket company, is now valued at nearly $36 billion.
