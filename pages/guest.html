            Hello! I am called Estelle Yomba (Mrs), a Social Entrepreneur with an unquenchable passion for quality Education. My academic and professional life has been characterized by the little word “minority.”

            I am the little one (last born) from a family of 8. Thus, at home I have always tried to make my voice heard as the little one. In my primary school days at Ecole Public Annexe de Nkongsamba in Cameroon, 
            I was the smallest in school and was always bullied. The prejudice feeling as the minority in every place I found myself continued in secondary school as I was still the smallest in class but the brightest.

            Programmer and designer, the Founder of Kiro'o Games took the time to design "Aurion: Legacy of the Kori-Odan". Thirteen years to see the birth of a video game "made in Cameroon". The project was funded through a crowdfunding campaign.

            Since April 14, 2016, Cameroon has therefore entered the video game market in Africa. A market that is both attractive and very competitive. Already in place: Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt and South Africa. "Aurion: the Heritage of the Kori-Odan" is inspired 
            by African culture and imagination. The hero of the game, Enzo Koni-Odan, seeks alongside his fiancée, Erine Evou, to regain his throne, usurped by his brother-in-law.
            "It is not a question of good against evil. It is a question of a quest and of surpassing oneself", specifies Olivier Madiba.
